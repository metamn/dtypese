## Exercise 8.

My main language is PHP. You can find the comments about the approach there.

* PHP code online: http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/code/9a60c1aae2340b2b199629b33ccee6860395b89d
* JS code online: https://codepen.io/metamn/pen/OBXzaE
* Go code online: https://go-sandbox.com/#/GhJVfsaQJoG

Notes to Doctype

I write code for others first then for the machine. That's why I don't optimize for density but rather to verbosity. It might not looking elegant and spiffy but is better maintainable, I hope.

Notes to self:

* PHP is surprisingly verbose when written according to standards: 79 vs. 20 vs. 40 LOC
* PHP has a far better random number generator. JS and Go yields the same results.
* JS is pure beauty
* Go, at first usage, has some *strange* complexity like fixed width arrays, slicing, `:=` or `=` seems to be the same
